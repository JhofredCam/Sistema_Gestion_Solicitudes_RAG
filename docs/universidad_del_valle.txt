The Universidad del Valle (Univalle), commonly known as Univalle, is a public university in Colombia, considered the leading higher education institution in the country's southwest. Founded on June 11, 1945, it has its main campus in Cali and regional campuses throughout the Valle del Cauca and northern Cauca departments. Univalle holds High Quality Institutional Accreditation, renewed for a maximum period of ten years in 2024, a distinction shared with only a few other top Colombian universities. It serves over 30,000 students across 373 academic programs (211 undergraduate and 162 postgraduate) and is a major research hub in Colombia, housing 450 research groups, notably in water resources (CINARA) and seismology (G7). The university's faculty includes a high percentage of members with doctoral and master's degrees. Univalle's main campus in Cali, Ciudad Universitaria Meléndez, is one of Colombia's largest, featuring extensive green areas. It also has a San Fernando campus, home to its Health Faculty. The university actively engages in media through Univalle Estéreo (radio), Canal Universitario (TV), and UVTV (production house), and its editorial program publishes numerous scientific journals and cultural newspapers like "La Palabra." It maintains strong ties with the Hospital Universitario del Valle for medical training and research.
